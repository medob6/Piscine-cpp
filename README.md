# 42 Piscine C++

Welcome to the **C++ Piscine** at **42 School**, an intensive coding bootcamp that provides hands-on exercises to build an in-depth understanding of **C++ programming**. Designed for individuals with a foundational knowledge of the **C language**, these modules focus on key concepts in modern object-oriented programming and data structures.

*All exercises are written in C++98, as mandated by the curriculum.*

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is organized into multiple modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of C++ programming:

- **[Cpp00](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp00)**: Introduction to core differences between **C** and **C++**, including namespaces, classes, member functions, and I/O streams.
- **[Cpp01](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp01)**: Memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and the usage of `switch`.
- **[Cpp02](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp02)**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the orthodox canonical form.
- **[Cpp03](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp03)**: Implementation of inheritance in C++.
- **[Cpp04](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp04)**: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.
- **[Cpp05](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp05)**: Exception handling with `try`, `catch`, and `throw`. For more details, check out the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/C-Exceptions-2bab71edad8c807db446d6cf6e89385f?source=copy_link).
- **[Cpp06](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp06)**: Type casting in C++ — `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and `const_cast`. Explore the [overview on Notion](https://www.notion.so/C-Casts-2bab71edad8c80a6bb69e0a4d90b950c?source=copy_link).
- **[Cpp07](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp07)**: An introduction to templates — function and class templates. Additional notes [available here](https://www.notion.so/Templates-2c1b71edad8c8076b5b8c14d1fe52ba7?source=copy_link).
- **[Cpp08](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp08)**: Exploration of template containers, iterators, and STL algorithms. [Detailed summary is available on Notion](https://www.notion.so/Containers-templates-2c0b71edad8c80248f81cbc1bb3d3c49?source=copy_link).
- **[Cpp09](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/Cpp09)**: Practical implementation of containers along with an in-depth exploration of STL concepts. Detailed notes on this module can be found in the [Notion document](https://www.notion.so/Minimum-Comparison-Sorting-2d1b71edad8c80acaad1e991e650707f?source=copy_link).
- **[Intro to C++](https://github.com/medob6/Piscine-cpp/tree/main/introto_cpp)**: Basic introduction to C++ programming concepts.
