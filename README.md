# 42 Piscine C++

The **C++ Piscine** at **42 School** is a series of small, focused exercises designed to teach the fundamentals of **C++** to students who already understand the basics of the **C language**.

Each module explores specific concepts in C++ through hands-on practice, gradually building a strong foundation in modern object-oriented programming.

> **Note:** All exercises must be written in **C++98**, as mandated by the curriculum.
