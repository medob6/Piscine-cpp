things learned soo far :

// Why C++ exists: it builds on C with stronger type checking, abstraction (classes, templates), and a richer standard library.

// Preprocessor statements: #include, #define, conditional compilation, and utility macros like assert.

// How to compile with -std=c++98: this keeps you disciplined in the version you want to learn.

// Namespaces: to organize and avoid naming collisions (std being the key example).

// Core types: built-in types (int, double, etc.) and standard library types like std::string and std::vector.

// C library headers in C++ style: e.g. <cstdio>, <cstdlib>, <cstring> instead of <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>.

// the input output streams and the use of them like " cin >> " and " cout << " and "cerr << "

// first mention of manipulator like " endl "  write \n and flush to terminal

// the scope operator adding "std:: " to a statment means use this func from the std lib

// std::cin >> value fails if input cannot be converted to the type of value.  those the statements evaluate to false

// there is mutiple c++ casting methods like static_cast reinterpret_cast const_cast dynamic_cast , each have a spicial use

// some basics types the same as the ones i am used to in c + short and w_char and some of there uses 

// new thing like reference and the use of control statements in c++ , but in all its the same as c

//

// classes , the how and the why ...
